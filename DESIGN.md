# Design

## Game Scale
### Time
Each turn is 1 minute.
### Distance
#### Nautical Mile
We define a nautical mile to be 1,853.184 meters, which is the UK Admiralty nautical mile.

We use the UK Admiralty nautical mile because

1. It was in use during the time period covered by the game
2. We wanted to use a single unit for all navies.

FWIW, the current definition of a nautical mile is 1,852 meters.

#### Table Top
1 millimeter on the table represents 1 meter in the "real world."

### Speed
We use the "knot" as our unit for velocity.
We define the knot as 1 UK Admiralty nautical mile per hour.

1 knot is equal to 30.8864 meters per minute.

We abbreviate "knot" as "kn."

# Notes
## Why use Knots for velocity?
Per the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)):
a vessel travelling at 1 knot along a meridian travels approximately one minute of geographic latitude in one hour.
