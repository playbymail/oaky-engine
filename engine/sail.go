	// Generally headsails and driver.

	// Generally reefed topsails.
	// A good setting for battle, as it provides a stable
	// gunnery platform and allows for fine maneuvering.
	FIGHTING_SAIL

	// Generally mainsails and topsails. Easy to manage.
	ALL_PLAIN_SAIL

	// Topgallants and royals.
	// Fast, difficult to manage, lacks easy maneuverability.
	FULL_SAIL

	// Courses, studding sails, gaffsails, staysails, and
	// other weird creations of the sailmakerâ€™s art.
	// Hard to handle, very fast, with very little maneuverability.
